## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run Inventech locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB instance running locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal/command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdul121104/inventech.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd inventech
    ```

### Install Dependencies

The project has two parts: **Frontend** (React) and **Backend** (Node.js). You need to install dependencies for both.

#### Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend\vite-project
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

#### Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration

#### MongoDB:

- If you are using MongoDB locally, make sure MongoDB is installed and running.
- If using **MongoDB Atlas**, create a cluster and get the connection string.
- Update the `MONGO_URI` in the `.env` file in the backend directory with your MongoDB connection string.

### Run the Application

1. **Run the Backend**: Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    or 
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the backend server on port `5000` (or whatever port you configure in your `.env` file).

2. **Run the Frontend**: In the frontend directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the frontend application and open it in your browser. The frontend will communicate with the backend running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Accessing the Application

Once both the frontend and backend are running, open your browser and navigate to the link where the the local server is running
